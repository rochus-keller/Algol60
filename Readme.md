## About this project

Algol 60 is the mother of nearly all imperative programming languages existing today. And it turns 60 years this year (2020) which is a good reason to take again a closer look at it. The original Algol 60 language report appeared in May 1960 in the venerable Communications of the ACM. For several years I have been thinking about building a compiler for the language Simula 67 which is a superset of Algol 60. To build a parser (and possibly a compiler) for Algol 60 is therefore on the way to the Simula compiler. So here we go.

Algol was the first language which was specified using the "Backusâ€“Naur form" (BNF), yet another pioneering achievment. I took the BNF from the revised report and converted it in an LL(1) EBNF using my EbnfStudio tool (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/EbnfStudio, which I had to extend a bit to handle the unusual unicode symbols used by Algol). 

The generated parser successfully reads the examples of Marst, Katwijk-algol-60, racket-algol60 and swornimgrg-algol60. The AlgLc application can be used to parse all algol files in a directory. I also implemented a syntax highlighter and a little Algol60 editor based on Qt (called AlgLjEditor, see screenshot). I added a LuaJIT terminal and bytecode viewer in case I will implement an Algol 60 to LuaJIT bytecode compiler (as I already did e.g. in https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon). This is work in progress.

### Binary versions

Not yet available.

### Build Steps

Follow these steps if you want to build the Class Browser yourself:

1. Make sure a Qt 5.x (libraries and headers) version compatible with your C++ compiler is installed on your system.
1. Download the source code from https://github.com/rochus-keller/Algol60/archive/master.zip and unpack it.
1. Goto the unpacked directory and execute `QTDIR/bin/qmake AlgLjEditor.pro` (see the Qt documentation concerning QTDIR).
1. Run make; after a couple of seconds you will find the executable in the build directory.

Alternatively you can open AlgLjEditor.pro using QtCreator and build it there.
